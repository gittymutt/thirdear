  		<div class="panel-body">
    Having money conflicts? You’re not alone.! Statistics continue to show that financial problems cause considerable stress in marriages and often lead couples to divorce. Businesses large and small close their doors each year due to cash flow insufficiencies. The average American has approximately $15K in personal credit card debt and $33K in student loan debt, and wage rates are not increasing as fast as the rate of inflation on goods and services. Remember when banks used to pay 3% or more in interest on the money you allow them to borrow to make themselves money? You’re lucky now if you can get a full 1% interest income on those funds tied up at your bank. These details reflect the current circumstances for most people. So, forgive yourself for having conflicts. Let’s get started on minimizing the adverse effects of your cirucumstances.
