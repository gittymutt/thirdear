            Many of us would love to win the lottery, but it’s not a great selection here because it leaves you reliant on odds that are heavily stacked against you (approx. 1 in 176,000,000). As you might know, you have a greater chance of becoming President of the United States, becoming a movie star, being struck by lightning, or being crushed to death by a vending machine. Ruling the US or starring in a revenue-generating film comes with some good financial benefits and “perks,” but if neither of those are appealing, I recommend:
            <ol>
                <li>Save the money you had been spending on lottery tickets, and start building your emergency fund.</li>
                <li><a href="money_conflicts_3.html">Go back one screen</a> in this Wizard and select another resolution.</li>
                <li>If you really enjoy playing the lottery so much that you would do it even without the possibility of a jackpot, get a friend to agree to exchange tickets with you on birthdays, holidays and other special occasions.</li>
 		    </ol>
